== objectivation / contextualization / system request ==
_Assumption: System knows "view profiles" query (responds using the google membership api by default, for example) _

User enters "view larry page profile". System:
  * matches the query with the "view profiles" and finds that the grammar is the same and the semantics also, through specified rules
  * (implicitely?) objectivizes the query by putting the "larry page" in the context of an item of the profiles collection
  * target-contextualizes by looking for a method to search profiles on the target api
  * objectivizes the search (based on attribute name priority order rules) by looking prioritary in the "name" field
